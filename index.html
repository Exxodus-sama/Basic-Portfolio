        Welcome dear reader to my page! My name is Othoniel; but that's too long and a mouthful, so please call me Otho (Oh-Toe).
    </p>
    <p>
        I was born in Mexico; but have lived most of my life in Chicago. I consider myself to be quite serious and not very outgoing, but that doesn't mean I'm boring! (hopefully...)
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm just an avarage guy with nerdy/geeky intrests: video games and anime. My favorite type of music is hip-hop and jazz, particularly styles that involve the piano. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I began my coding career because I wanted to change myself. Up until this point, I was an electrician; and even though it is a respecable career, I feel that it is not for me. 
        I feel that there is something else that I could be doing and that is programming. Essensially, I started my coding career to gateway into computer science to do software development.
        I know it won't be easy and that I have along road ahead of me, but good things don't come easy. 
    </p>
